To check the status of Rollouts
kubectl rollout status deployment/deployment_name   (Status)
kubectl rollout history deployment/deployment_name  (History)
kubectl rollout undo deployment/deployment_name  ( For rollback to previous version)
kubectl set image deployment/frontend www=image:v2 ( For changing the image imperatively )


Deployment strategy : 
1. Recreate ( all applications will down first after this the application will reday with newer version. The problem is we cant acheive ZDD( Zero downtime deployment is a method for releasing 
software or making updates to a system without causing downtime for users)

2. Rolling updates 

Note : Rolling updates is default Deployment strategy.
