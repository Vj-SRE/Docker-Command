Request and limit

Quality of service 
Besteffort : If you not mention any request and limits at the container level
Burstable : Request is smaller than limit
Guranteed : Request = limit

Note: If you not specify ant request but limit  is specefied the k8s will allot the specefied limit to the pod.
