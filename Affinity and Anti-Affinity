NodeAffinity and NodeAntiaffinity provides advance feature to schedule the pod as compare to NodeSelector .

There are two types of nodeAffinity avilable :

1. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. 
This functions like nodeSelector, but with a more expressive syntax.


2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. 
If a matching node is not available, the scheduler still schedules the Pod.

In the preceding types, IgnoredDuringExecution means that if the node labels change after Kubernetes schedules the Pod, the Pod continues to run.
