Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them. 
Unlike Pods that are managed by the control plane (for example, a Deployment); 
instead, the kubelet watches each static Pod (and restarts it if it fails).

Kubelet read the files directly from /etc/kubernetes/manifests 

Kubelet only able to create static pods this way.

You can get the path details while describing kubelet there static pod path was configured or you can view kubeconfig.yaml

You cant view the pods status using kubectl because you dont have the fully configure cluster yet(all componets of master node).
In this case you have to use crictl, docker command as container tool

The default path for the "kubeletconfig.yaml" file is "/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

Note: If you want to deploy any pod as static pod like kube-api, kube-controller,kube-schedula etc the you have to create pod.yaml in k8s manifest path (/etc/kubernetes/manifests )
or you have to check the static path configured in ( /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml).

The static pod managed by kubelet.
