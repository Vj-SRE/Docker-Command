The thing which we can not define using RBAC will controlled by Admissions Controllers.

like : Only permit image from certain registary
       dont permit run cainter as a user root
       only permit certain capability.
       Metadata always contains labels 

Admission comtrollers : always pull images
                        Default storage class
                        Namespaces Exists 
                        NamespaceAutoProvision
                        etc

Example: We you trying to create any resources in that name space which doest exists.
         First will check your authentication and authorization (rbac) and the admission controller comes in the picture the name spaces exist admissons controler will check 
         the defined ns will exists or not. if not then request is rejected.

kubectl exec kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kube-system -- kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep admission-plugins


To add/enable any admissons controller 
kube-apiserver.service edit the enable admisson plugins and edit the yaml file in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kuber-apiserver.yaml.

Admisson controllers: 
1. validating Admisson controllers 
2. mutating Admisson controllers
Note: the flow of invocation of admission controllers : First mutating then validating
